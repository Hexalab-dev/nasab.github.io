# Critique: Dissent Theory

*When Does Minority Override Majority?*

---

## The Problem

Collective validation relies on consensus.

But consensus has failed catastrophically throughout history.

---

## Historical Consensus Failures

| Consensus | Duration | Truth |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Earth is flat | Millennia | Wrong |
| Sun orbits Earth | 1,400+ years | Wrong |
| Miasma causes disease | Centuries | Wrong |
| Bloodletting heals | Centuries | Harmful |
| Lobotomy treats mental illness | Decades | Harmful |
| Efficient Market Hypothesis | Decades | Incomplete at best |

The majority was confident. The majority was wrong.

## The Core Question

Nasab includes "dissent preservation."

But preservation isn't enough.

**When does dissent get promoted over consensus?**

---

## Current Framework

Three validation layers:
1. Human consensus
2. Internal consistency
3. Reality check

Dissent preserved but not prioritized.

---

## The Gap

What happens when:
- Dissent has no immediate reality anchor?
- Dissent contradicts internal consistency (because the system is wrong)?
- Dissent comes from low-reputation source (but is correct)?

Preservation means the dissent survives.

It doesn't mean the dissent wins.

---

## Proposed Escalation Rules

### Rule 1: Reality Anchor Override
If minority view has verifiable reality anchor (code works, math checks, experiment confirms):

**→ Escalate regardless of consensus count**

Reality votes, and reality's vote counts more than popularity.

### Rule 2: High-Reputation Source
If minority view comes from established high-reputation validator:

**→ Extended quarantine, active investigation, not dismissal**

Some sources have earned benefit of the doubt.

### Rule 3: Thin Consensus
If consensus is thin (51/49, 60/40):

**→ No incorporation. Flag as contested. Require stronger signal.**

Weak consensus is not consensus.

### Rule 4: Persistent Dissent
If dissent survives across multiple generations without resolution:

**→ Investigate why it persists**

Persistent dissent might indicate:
- Genuine disagreement (legitimate)
- Edge case the majority doesn't encounter
- Fundamental flaw in majority view

### Rule 5: Novel Information
If dissent introduces information not available to majority:

**→ Pause, gather information, re-evaluate**

Consensus formed without relevant data is invalid consensus.

---

## The Deeper Problem

Even these rules assume we can identify when dissent is correct.

But the whole point of novel truth is that **it's not yet recognized as true**.

If we could easily identify correct dissent, it wouldn't be dissent — it would be accepted.

---

## Historical Pattern

New truth typically follows this path:

```
Proposer states new idea
       ↓
Rejected by consensus ("obviously wrong")
       ↓
Proposer persists, gathers evidence
       ↓
Small group adopts ("interesting fringe")
       ↓
Evidence accumulates
       ↓
Consensus cracks
       ↓
New consensus forms
       ↓
Previous consensus holders claim they always knew
```

This takes years to decades. How does an AI system compress this?

## Possible Approaches

### 1. Bet Tracking
Allow dissenters to "bet" on their position. Track outcomes. Correct bets increase reputation.

Market-like mechanism for truth discovery.

### 2. Minority Report System
Formally preserve and present minority views alongside consensus.

User sees: "Consensus says X. Minority view: Y."

Decision-maker has full information.

### 3. Time-delayed Validation
Don't fully incorporate consensus immediately. Wait for real-world outcomes.

Slower but catches consensus failures.

### 4. Domain-specific Dissent Weights
In domains with fast feedback (code), consensus wins quickly.

In domains with slow feedback (strategy), preserve dissent longer.

### 5. Explicit Uncertainty
When consensus is not overwhelming, communicate uncertainty.

"70% of validators believe X. This is not settled."

---

## The Honest Limitation

Nasab has mechanisms for dissent preservation.

Nasab does not have a complete theory of dissent promotion.

This remains an open problem.

---

## Why It Matters

If the system always follows consensus:
- Novel truth gets suppressed
- Errors get locked in
- The system becomes conservative, then stagnant

If the system too easily promotes dissent:
- Noise overwhelms signal
- Cranks get amplified
- Stability disappears

The balance is hard. We don't claim to have solved it.

*Preserving dissent is necessary. Knowing when to promote it is wisdom we haven't fully encoded.*
